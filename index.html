		<p>Hello! My name is Anne Oursler, and I'm a Computer Science student at Tufts University! I love learning, fencing, coding, and hanging out with friends.</p>
		<p>This website is both a portfolio of my work and an opportunity for me to practice what I've learned. That brings me to classes. I have taken six courses from the Tufts Computer Science Department and am taking two more this semester. </p>
		<p>The spring of my freshman year I took Comp11 (Introduction to Computer Science). It's taught in C++ and I had a great time. Going into the class I thought there was no way I would want to pursue Computer Science. By the end of the semester, I had fallen in love, declared my major as compsci, and was excited to be on my journeny into the world of Computer Science.</p> 
		<p>Then my sophmore year I took a total of five Computer Science related classes. I took Comp15 (Datastructures and Algorithms), Comp20 (Web Programming), and Comp61 (Discrete Mathmatics) in the fall. In the spring I took Comp40 (Machine Structure), and Comp50WD (Wearable Devices). I learned so much and loved almost every minute of it! (Not gonna lie, being up at 4 am to finish Comp15's final project, Boggle, was not my favorite moment.) Those classes shaped who I am today. I learned about hardware from the first day ("So what's a resistor?") to the final project. I learned that I am fundamentally happiest making, and I began 3D printing and designing far more out of class. I learned how to pair program and get seemingly imposible tasks done, from image compression to emulators and assembly.</p>
		<p>This past summer I worked for MITRE, helping to create an IoT lab three as well as a IoT Unique Identification Challenge to further inspire contestants to find new methods of identifying devices on IoT networks. I am currently taking Comp105 (Programming Languages) and Comp116 (Security). It should be a great semester with lots of new projects, and hopefully a few on my own time. Stay tuned to see what I do next!</p>

			MITRE Challenge, Unique Identification of IoT Devices<br>
			<p><div id = "textblock">
			A government-sponsored challenge to discover a novel way to passively uniquely identify devices on an Internet of Things network. This challenge was created as part of my Internship at MITRE in the summer of 2016. More information about this challenge can be found at<br>
			https://www.mitre.org/research/mitre-challenge/mitre-challenge-iot

			<h4>
			Skeletron<br>
			<p><div id = "textblock">
			A story about your skeleton's nighttime activities that generates a story with real places near the given location. It includes a map view of your skeleton's movements and opinion of the places it visits. The project was created for Polyhack 2015, where it won for first-time hackathon participants. The project is no longer live, due to both the lack of sustainable servers at the hackathon and the expiration of the trip advisor api key. The code for this project can be found at <br>
