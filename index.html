			<p>Hello! My name is Anne Oursler, and I'm a Computer Science student at Tufts University! I love learning, fencing, and hanging out with friends.</p>
			<p>This website is both a portfolio of my work and an opportunity for me to practice what I've learned. That brings me to classes. I have taken four courses from the Tufts Computer Science Department and am taking two more this semester. </p>
			<p>The spring of my freshman year I took Comp11 (Introduction to Computer Science). It's taught in C++ and I had a great time. Going into the class I thought there was no way I would want to pursue Computer Science. By the end of the semester, I had fallen in love, declared my major as compsci, and was excited to be on my joureny into the world of Computer Science.</p> 
			<p>The fall of my sophmore year, three of my courses were Computer Science related. I took Comp15 (Datastructures and Algorithms), Comp20 (Webprograming), and Comp61 (Discrete Mathmatics). I learned so much and loved almost every minute of it! (Not gonna lie, being up at 4 am to finish Comp15's final project, Boggle, was not my favorite moment.)</p>
			<p>This semester, only two of my courses are Computer Science. I'm taking Comp40 (Machine Structure), and Comp50 (Wearable Devices). It should be a great semester with lots of new projects. Stay tuned to see what I make next!</p>
			<p>Please explore my site, and be sure to check out my github, <i>aoursler!</i></p>
