			<p>Hello! My name is Anne Oursler, and I'm a Computer Science student at Tufts University! I love learning, fencing, and hanging out with friends.</p>
			<p>This website is both a portfolio of my work, and an oportunity for me to practice what I learned. That brings me to classes. At this time I have taken four courses from the Tufts Computer Science Department, and am taking two more this semester. </p>
			<p>The spring of my freshman year I took Comp11, or Intro to Computer Science. It's taught in C++ and was a great time. Going into the class I thought there was no way I would ever want to seriously pursue computer science. By the end of the semester I had fallen in love, declared my major as compsci, and was excited to begin my journy into the world of computer science.</p> 
			<p>The fall of my sophmore year, three of my four courses were computer science related. I took Comp15, Datastructures and Algoritms, Comp20, Webprograming, and Comp61, Discrete Mathmatics. I learned so much and loved almost every minute of it! (Not gonna lie, being up at 4 am to finish comp15's final project, Boggle, was not my favorite moment.)</p>
			<p>This upcoming semester, only two of my four courses will be computer science. I'm taking Comp40, or Machine Structure, and Comp50, or wearables. It should be a great semester, with lots of new projects. Stay tuned to see what I make next!</p>
			<p>Please, explore my site, and be sure to check out my github aoursler!</p>
