  <h1>4-Voice Harmony Generator</h1>
  <h3>4-Voice Harmony Generator is a project I made the fall of my sophmore year. It's a little complicated because it is so specific to musicians and composers. It allows the user to give it notes and creates a four-voice harmony with the given notes as the basis. This project was created in its entirety by me and the rest of group 9 for the Comp20 final project, the theme of which was music.</h3>
  <h3>The project can be a bit tricky to use for people without a musical background. If you want to play around with it and don't have a musical background, try clicking on "Click To Chose A Chord," then enter a duration, such as one, and click "Submit Chord," then click "Generate Song." Below the song will be created as sheet music. Other features exist as well, so feel free to explore and find them all.</h3>
