  <h1>Skeletron</h1>
  <h3><br>In the Fall of 2015, I attended my first ever hackathon, Polyhack. At the hackathon, I joined a group that was using mostly Javascript, a language I had only briefly been exposed to, to create a storytelling engine. Over 24 hours later, Skeletron was born.<br>
  <br>Skeletron is no longer running due to the lack of a server and the expiration of one of our main API keys. However, it is my favorite of the projects I have done, because it represents a time when I picked up a skill far faster than I would have expected myself to, and colaborated on a team to build something that I would never have imagined that I could have made before. If you want to check out our code, go to <br> <a href="https://github.com/aoursler/polyhack2015">https://github.com/aoursler/polyhack2015.</a>
  <br>Skeletron was the story of what your skeleton did at night. The website followed your skeleton as it traveled around your area, or an area of your choice. It generated a random sentence for each location it visited. These sentences were themed to the type of attraction.<br> 
  <br>As it did this, an animated skeletron ran around on google maps. It plotted a path around to local atractions, and as it visited them, its animation changed to become either happy or angry based on the tripadviosor API ratings for the attraction. The feature that I was most happy with at the end of the project was the fact that the skeleton could be viewed in streetview, its animation actually ran down the street!</h3>
