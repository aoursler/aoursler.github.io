  <h1>Sudoku</h1>
  <h3>I made a simple sudoku solver the summer after Comp11. I have not yet put the final product onto a website, or built a front end implementation for it, so it is quite difficult to display. Nonetheless this project was my first independent project. The solver works much the same way that I myself solve sudoku. It searches each empty spot for all the possible options for each square via vertial, horizonal, and block methods. If there is only one possibility, it changes the spot to be that number. </h3>
