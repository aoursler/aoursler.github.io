  <h1>Boggle</h1>
  <h3>Boggle is a game I made the fall of my sophmore year. It's pretty simple; you try to create as many words as you can within the board. The letters in your word must be connected to each other, but they don't all have to be in a straight line. They can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal to their previous letter. The front end for this game was given to us as part of the final assignment for my Data Structures and Algorithms class, while the back end was the assignment itself.</h3>
  <h3>To play the game, first chose the size of the board as either 4x4 or 5x5, which will also initiate the generation of the board. Then type the words that you see into the box below your words. When the time limit is up, press "Check" to find your score, or "Solve" to show all the possible words you could have made.</h3>
