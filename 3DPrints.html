	<h1>3D Prints</h1>
	<h3>This past semester I learned of the existance of makerspaces on Tufts Campus. I learned how to lazer cut, then 3D print, then I was hooked. I have printed everything from turtles roses and vases to project casings. I have also become quite enthusiatic about cadding. Asside from the multiple casings I have cadded, I have also moddled a version of Sting from the hobbit, which not only includes engraved details, but also includes a semi-hollow center which thoretically could contain leds such as a nano-pixel strip that could make it glow blue. Below are a few pixtures of my prints as well as renderings of my CADs.</h3>
